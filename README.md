# `cirq` â€” design _your_ electronics

_cirq_ is a modern solution for schematic and layout editing, runnable in your web-browser, but working fully offline.
What, a browser-based offline solution?
Yes, you can use this application from within your browser, but all of your data is hosted offline an will _never_ sent via the network: the browser is just the easiest way to obtain the software.
You can even install this as a so-called [progressive web app][pwa], which leads to a native feeling on all devices.
